# MicroServiz :: EmailConfirmation

A *Koa*-based email confirmation microservice.
Part of gbezyuk's `microserviz` project.

## Use Case

Usually it happens during user registration.
You want to make sure the user does really own the email entered.
So we generate a random token and send it there.
Then when the user presents that token, we consider email ownership proven.

And this REST microservice handles exactly this issue:
* it sets up an in-memory database with a single table, which contains:
    * emails,
    * tokens, and
    * confirmation status flag
* it sends and resends emails,
* and it provides the endpoint for email confirmation

It is supposed to be used by the frontend / universal app in course of registration scenario.
But maybe you'll find some other use case when you want email ownership checked.


## Production Run

Modify `./start.sh`, exporting proper env variables, and run it (or better setup a supervisor).
Alternatively, run `npm run serve` manually.


## Dev Run

`npm run dev` will start a nodemon which will watch source code changes.
